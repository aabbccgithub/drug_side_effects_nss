Predicting side effects caused due to drug-drug interactions

Introduction:
Pharmaceutical drugs are important part of our daily lives. While some relieve
symptoms, others help to cure disease or condition. However, these drugs also cause side effects ranging from mild, severe to life threatening. Just like personality clashes, there are drug clashes. That is, some drugs produce undesirable side effects with intake of other drugs. This results in life threatening conditions and hospitalizations.

Why the need to predict?
Predicting undesirable side effects due to intake of more than one drug helps pharmaceutical companies, the patients and the doctors. Pharmaceutical companies spend millions of dollars and 15-20 years to bring a drug to the market. Only about 2-5 percentage of drugs discovered in the lab get approved by FDA and successfully reach the market. Prediction will also benefit physicians when patients encounter side effects that were not reported before.
